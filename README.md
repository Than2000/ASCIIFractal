# ASCII-Fractal

A simple program for printing fractals to the command line. Guaranteed to have absolutely no practical use.

AF can draw the Mandelbrot set and arbitrary filled Julia sets with partial support for the Sierpinski triangle. There are various settings that can be changed from within the program: center, zoom level, window size, show/hide axes, etc. Typing `help` gives a list of available commands and `help [command]` gives a description of that command. Obviously, ASCII art is not known for high resolution images, so it's recommended you set your text size as small as you can while still being able to read it.

This was basically just a project to teach me Haskell, so I have in no way bothered to optimize anything. Don't set your expectations too high. That being said: it's pretty fun to mess around with.

I have no idea if I'll ever come back to this project. If by some miracle anyone sees this, and also happens to be insane enough to fork it, I would love to see your work.
